I’m a PhD candidate, passionate about applied mathematics and sciences. I'm currently working in the Inria ABS team ("ABS" stands for Algorithm, Biology, Structure), supervised by <a href="https://team.inria.fr/abs/fr/team-members/homepage-frederic-cazals/">Frederic Cazals</a> and Alix Lheritier. During my PhD, I will investigate non-parametric hypothesis testing as well as sampling techniques tailored for conformational exploration. Prior to my PhD position, I received an engineer degree from <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/">Télécom Paris</a> and a Msc in Machine Learning from ENS Paris-Saclay in December 2024.
