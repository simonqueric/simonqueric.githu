During my internship at L'HÃ´pital des Quinze-Vingts, Summer 2023, I proposed the following pipeline in order to perform vessel segmentation in Retina images obtained with Laser Doppler Holography :

1) A preprocessing step which consists to enhance vessels structures with a Frangi filter.

2) A U-Net architecture to learn a segmentation model.
