<!-- # Retina Vessel Segmentation based on Frangi vesselness filter and UNet architecture. -->

During my internship at L'HÃ´pital des Quinze-Vingts, Summer 2023, I proposed the following pipeline in order to perform vessel segmentation in Retina images obtained with Laser Doppler Holography :

1) A preprocessing step which consists to enhance vessels structures with a Frangi filter.

2) A U-Net architecture to learn a segmentation model. 

You can find my internship report (in french) <a href="/assets/pdf/projet-M1.pdf"> here </a> and the github repository <a href="https://github.com/simonqueric/RetinaVesselSegmentation"> there </a>.

### Results

Here are some images and plots of my results.
